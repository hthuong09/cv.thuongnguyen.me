With over 8 years of experience in software engineering, I bring a wealth of expertise to the table. My journey has equipped me with a robust product mindset and versatile skills across backend, frontend, database management, and system administration domains.

I specialize in architecting and building large-scale systems with a keen focus on ensuring high availability and reliability. My approach to development is rooted in crafting solutions that not only meet immediate needs but also scale gracefully with evolving demands.

One of my strengths lies in effective communication, enabling seamless collaboration with stakeholders across business and technical spectrums. I thrive in environments where bridging the gap between diverse perspectives leads to innovative solutions and successful outcomes.
